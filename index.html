      This is a story about this medical doctor trying to learn a bit about frontend.
      He is enthusiastic about this and needs help in achieving his aim. It is really interesting getting
      this far. Looking forward to seeing your feedback. I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
      Thanks.  <a id="tribute-link" href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank"> more about me.</a>
